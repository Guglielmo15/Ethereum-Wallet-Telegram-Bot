# Ethereum-Wallet-Telegram-Bot
This is a Python-based Telegram bot that allows users to create Ethereum wallets, import existing wallets using private keys, check their ETH balance, and send ETH to other addresses. The bot uses the web3.py library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the Telebot library for Telegram bot functionality.

####How to make it works:

First of all, you need to create a bot in Telegram and get an HTTP API token to connect to it, in order to do so go to BotFather in Telegram (https://t.me/BotFather), create a new bot by following the instructions, give it a name and then you'll get your secret HTTP API token;

Copy and paste the code from "main.py" in this repository in any code editor, the best one is PyCharm Community Edition and thanks to this IDE you can compile the code and check that it doesn't throw any error;

Before to compile you should run 2 simple commands in the console to install the libraries that we need:
* pip install web3
* pip install pyTelegramBotAPI

Note that you have to make 3 small changes to the code before to compile it and before to go ahead with the next and last step:
* line 9: insert your secret HTTP API token generated by BotFather
* line 77: insert your blockchain API KEY to be able to connect to the desired chain
* line 135: same as above
* N.B.: you can get your blockchain API KEY by signing up to Infura (https://www.infura.io/) and I reccomend to insert the Goerli endpoint since you must try this    telegram bot in the Ethereum testnet. I do NOT reccomend to use it on Ethereum mainnet

Now it's time to bring the code on a server in order to make the bot actually running, to do so I've created an account on "https://www.pythonanywhere.com/", once you have your account ready to go just simply create a new Python file in "Files" and copy and paste the code. PythonAnywhere is a cool solution to test bots because it's free and it doesn't stop running, in the worst case scenario it simply slows your server, so this solution is perfect for what we need to do;

Once you have copied the code in the file in PythonAnywhere you have to repeat "step 2.1", PythonAnywhere provides you a bash console that let you run your pip commands;

The bot is READY! Go back to BotFather, click on the link to your telegram bot and enjoy it ðŸ¤–

### Commands
/help Command: Provides a quick description of the bot and displays available commands;

/createWallet Command: Allows users to create a new Ethereum wallet with a pair of public and private keys. The private key is sent to the user in the chat and it's store within the code, this is not a safe solution, that's way I invite you to read the disclaimer at the bottom of this document;

/importWallet Command: Allows users to restore an existing wallet by input the private key in the hexidecimal format (starts with '0x');

/balance Command: Allows users to retreive their ETH balance by checking the public key created or imported;

/send Command: Enables users to send ETH from their wallet to a specified receiver address. The bot verifies the validity of the address and initiates the transaction. If the transaction is sent succesfully it returns the transaction hash;

#### Note: This code is for educational purposes and intended to demonstrate the basic functionality of a cryptocurrency wallet bot. It should not be used in production without considering additional security measures and proper error handling.
